PDB INPUT FILE : PDB input file = ./tmp//tmp.pdb
X-RAYS or NEUTRONS (X/N): Number of I(Q) values: Maximum Q value: Intensity at I(0): Flag = 0, water mass density that of bulk water.  
flag = 1, surface polar residues hydrated with water mass density of bound water, SAAS caculation.  
Flag = 2, all surface residues hydrated with water mass density of bound water.  
Enter Hydration choice:  Input percent D2O in solvent (0-100 percent): Input fraction of exchanged NH peptide (0.8-0.9): Number of output file iterations: (1-100): Number of HITS: (100-10000): Is protein (./tmp//tmp.pdb) protonated or deuterated? <H/D>: Reading input file ./tmp//tmp.pdb
