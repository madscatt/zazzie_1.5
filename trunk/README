NOTE: the name of the tar-ball will change based on what is currently available !!! "sassie_1.99_rev_0001.tar.gz" is an
example.  Your file name will be different.


Linux Installation:

(1) change to the new directory:

> cd sassie_1.99_rev_0001/

then type:

> sudo python installer.py

and answer the simple questions the installer will ask you:

(A)  chose /usr/local/bin as the default installation (i.e. enter "1")

Then sit back and wait (the CentOS installation takes quite a long time).  BTW, the Ubuntu install and behavior is probably better than CentOS.

(2)  To test the code (and gain access to the sassie_gui.py script that you need to run the program) 

> cd testing

and you then can run sassie by typing

> python sassie_gui.py

as before, move sassie_gui.py to your own working directory for your own projects.


NOTE: for CentOS installations to run sassie you have to type:

> /usr/local/bin/bin/python2.7 sassie_gui.py

to run sassie.

of course you can write an alias and/or put /usr/local/bin/bin in your default path:  for csh/tcsh you could type this in your .cshrc file in ~/

set path = ( /usr/local/bin/bin $path )

and then type:

> source ~/.cshrc

then you can run sassie by typing

> python2.7 sassie_gui.py

There is an "export" command you can use if you are a bash user ... put this in your ~/.bashrc 

export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin/bin 

then 

> source ~/.bashrc

to implement this.

I do NOT recommend that you create a soft link of the new python into /usr/bin/ or other places as this may break your operating system (yup, it happened to me).


 MacOSX Installation:

(0) run software update and make sure you are current (either 10.5.8, 10.6.8, or 10.7.4)

(1) make sure that you have installed the "Developer Tools" from your OS installation disk.  Specifically you need Xcode 3.X or 4.X (for Lion) installed.

***** NOTE ***** NEWER LION & MOUNTAIN LION INSTALLATIONS REQUIRE "COMMAND LINE TOOLS" to be installed.

(2) install AquaTerm 1.1.0.dmg using the supplied "DMG" installer located in sassie_0.99_rev134/sassie/distribution/macosx/.  This is a simple click the mouse type installation.

(3) install epd_free-7.1-2-macosx-i386.dmg using the supplied "DMG" installer located in sassie_0.99_rev134/sassie/distribution/macosx/.  This is a simple click the mouse type installation.

(4) OPEN A NEW TERMINAL and change to the new directory (this is important ... otherwise the non-EPD python will try to install things) ... okay, if you are a Unix guru you can reset the terminal you are in by typing (csh or tcsh)

> rehash 

or for bash

> hash -r


> cd sassie_1.99_rev_001/


then type:

> sudo python installer.py

and answer the simple questions the installer will ask you:

(A)  chose /usr/local/bin as the default installation  (i.e. enter "1")  [[[ if /usr/local/bin does not exist the installer will prompt you to create it ]]]

and

Then sit back and wait.

(5)  To test the code (and gain access to the sassie_gui.py script that you need to run the program) 

OPEN a new terminal (or if you are using a csh or tcsh) type 

> rehash

or if you are in the bash shell . . . 

> hash -r


((( some users need to run gnuplot in a terminal to get AquaTerm to work with sassie apparently if you open a terminal and type > gnuplot  and then when the gnuplot prompt appears type  > plot sin(x)  a plot should show up.  Quit gnuplot ( > quit ) and then proceed again, two out of 10 users have had to do this for reasons we have not figured out yet )))

and you then can run sassie by typing

> python sassie_gui.py


as before, move sassie_gui.py to your own working directory for your own projects.
